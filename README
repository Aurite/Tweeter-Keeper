Tweeter Keeper is built on top of other people's work - I didn't see any reason to reinvent the wheel.

TweetStream gem - reads tweets off of Twitter's streaming API and provides a Ruby block with the tweets.

Twitter gem - for use with the other Twitter API's - use to get followers for a user, user's tweet timeline, etc. We can use this to backfill in the history for users we follow on the streaming side. Some methods on this will require OAuth authentication

MongoDB - NoSQL database that uses BSON (similar to JSON) for inserting and retrieving data, making it easy to dump data directly from Twitter without processing. 

Mongo gem - Use the Mongo Ruby Driver directly, instead of an abstraction library

Install
=============

Environment - requires Ruby and MongoDB.

gem install tweetstream
gem install twitter
gem install mongo
